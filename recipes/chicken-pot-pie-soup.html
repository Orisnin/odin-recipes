            <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless <strong>chicken breast</strong> halves</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons <strong>salted butter</strong></li>
            <li>6 tablespoons <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>evaporated milk</strong></li>
            <li>2 (32 ounce) cartons <strong>chicken broth</strong> (such as Swanson®)</li>
            <li>3 large <strong>russet potatoes</strong>, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>4 medium <strong>carrots</strong>, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 cube <strong>chicken bouillon</strong></li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons <strong>ground black pepper</strong></li>
            <li>1 pinch <strong>salt</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>frozen peas</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>frozen corn</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
    
            <li>Put 1/2 inch of water in a large pan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Place chicken in the simmering water, cover, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and shred when cool enough to handle.</li>
    
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot. Add flour and stir continuously with a wooden spoon or whisk until a thick paste forms; continue cooking roux for 2 minutes. Add evaporated milk; stir until incorporated. Add chicken broth and stir until no lumps remain. Bring to a boil.</li>
        
            <li>Add potatoes, carrots, chicken bouillon, pepper, and salt; cook until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
               
            <li>Add shredded chicken and frozen peas and corn. Cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            
        </ol>
